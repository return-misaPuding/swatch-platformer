# Swatch

## Description

I started this project as a way to learn Godot for [Playphone](https://playphone.hackclub.com). I had a couple of weird ideas along the way (e.g. color-based collision) which were hard for me to make as a beginner, but made me learn a lot about Godot.
Some precision is required, but the difficulty level certainly isn't hard

## Running

The project is accessible on [Itch.io](https://strawberryp.itch.io/swatch-platformer?password=midnight)

# Controls

- W,A,D for directional movement
- Q to cancel momentum (3 charges total; using the last one turns you colorless)
- E to cycle through colors (colorless->yellow->red->blue...)

debug builds only:
- H to skip to the next checkpoint, if the level has checkpoints
