# Swatch

## Description

I started this thing as a way to learn Godot for [Playphone](https://playphone.hackclub.com). I had a couple of weird ideas along the way (e.g. color-based collision) which were hard for me to make as a beginner, but made me learn a lot about Godot.
Currently, the levels are demo-like and will be probably changed in the future.

# Controls

- W,A,D for directional movement
- Q for a momentum cancel (3 charges total; using the last one turns you colorless)
- E to cycle through colors (colorless->yellow->red->blue...)
